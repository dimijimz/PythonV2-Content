    "# Mastering Python Conditional Statements Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1: Basic Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the core of conditional statements is crucial for decision-making in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 1.1:** Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.\n",
    "  - **Input:** Any integer.\n",
    "  - **Output:** A string stating whether the number is \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"zero\".\n",
    "  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Task 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` help in combining conditions for complex decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 2.1:** Create a program that determines if a year is a leap year using logical operators.\n",
    "  - **Input:** A year.\n",
    "  - **Output:** `True` if the year is a leap year, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Task 2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3: Nested Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Nesting allows deeper decision-making processes by layering conditions within conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 3.1:** Write a program that categorizes a person’s life stage as follows: \n",
    "  - **Child** (under 18)\n",
    "  - **Adult** (18-64)\n",
    "  - **Senior** (65 and older).\n",
    "  - **Input:** Age as an integer.\n",
    "  - **Output:** A string representing the life stage.\n",
    "  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Task 3.1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4: Complex Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "Use conditional statements to create more complex decision-making systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 4.1:** Write a program that asks for the temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius, and the unit to which you want to convert. It should then convert the temperature.\n",
    "  - **Input:** Temperature and the target unit (`\"Celsius\"` or `\"Fahrenheit\"`).\n",
    "  - **Output:** The converted temperature.\n",

    "## Exercise 5: Grading System\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a decision-making structure for a grading system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 5.1:** Write a program to convert a percentage score to a letter grade.\n",
    "  - **A:** 90–100\n",
    "  - **B:** 80–89\n",
    "  - **C:** 70–79\n",
    "  - **D:** 60–69\n",
    "  - **F:** Below 60\n",
    "  - **Input:** Score as a percentage.\n",
    "  - **Output:** The corresponding grade.\n",

    "# Functional Programming and Higher Order Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the world of functional programming in Python! This programming paradigm treats computation as evaluating mathematical functions and avoids changing states and mutable data. It's a powerful approach that leads to more predictable and bug-resistant code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Functional Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Predictability:** Pure functions with no side effects mean fewer bugs.\n",
    "* **Modularity:** Easier to break down problems into small functions.\n",
    "* **Ease of Testing:** Pure functions are straightforward to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First-Class Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python treats functions as first-class citizens. This means you can:\n",
    "* Assign functions to variables.\n",
    "* Pass functions as arguments to other functions.\n",
    "* Return functions as the results from other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher Order Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-order functions either take functions as arguments or return them. Examples in Python include `map` , `filter` , and `reduce` .\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Map Function\n",
    "\n",
    "`map()` applies a function to each item in an iterable, like a list, and returns a map object (an iterator).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))\n",
    "print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filter Function\n",
    "\n",
    "`filter()` creates an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
    "print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reduce Function\n",
    "\n",
    "`reduce()` applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "sum_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n",
    "print(sum_numbers)  # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions in Python are small anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "multiply = lambda x, y: x * y\n",
    "print(multiply(2, 3))  # Output: 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transforming Data:** Use `map` to convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n",
    "2. **Filtering Data:** Use `filter` to extract names starting with a particular letter from a list.\n",
    "3. **Aggregating Data:** Use `reduce` to calculate the total of a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming in Python can make your code more expressive and easier to understand. It's a different way of thinking about your code, but mastering it can significantly enhance the quality of your programs.\n"

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gain an understanding of modules in Python and their practical uses.\n",
    "* Explore the Python Standard Library and its various modules.\n",
    "* Learn about external libraries and their roles in extending Python's capabilities.\n",
    "* Develop skills in creating and utilizing custom modules.\n",
    "* Understand the role of `pip` in managing Python packages.\n",

    "### 1. Understanding Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules in Python are files containing Python code, such as functions, classes, or variables. They help in organizing and reusing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a file named `my_module.py` with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def say_hello(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this module in another file as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import my_module\n",
    "my_module.say_hello(\"Alice\")\n",
    "```"

    "### 2. Python Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Standard Library is a collection of modules pre-installed with Python. These modules provide functionalities ranging from mathematical operations to file I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commonly Used Standard Library Modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `math`: Provides mathematical functions.\n",
    "* `datetime`: For manipulating dates and times.\n",
    "* `os`: Interacts with the operating system.\n",
    "* `random`: Generates random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. External Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's capabilities are significantly extended by external libraries, which can be installed using `pip` .\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `numpy` , a popular library for numerical operations:\n"

    "### 5. Managing Dependencies with `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` is used for installing and managing Python packages. It interfaces with the Python Package Index (PyPI) to download and install packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "* Install a package: `pip install requests`\n",
    "* List installed packages: `pip list`\n",
    "* Save dependencies: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`\n",
    "* Install dependencies from a file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules in Python enhance code reuse and organization. The standard library offers essential tools, while external libraries extend Python's capabilities. Understanding how to create custom modules and manage dependencies with `pip` is crucial for Python development.\n"

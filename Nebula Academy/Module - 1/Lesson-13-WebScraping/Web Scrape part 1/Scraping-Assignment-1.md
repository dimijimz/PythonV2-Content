### Assignment: Scrape Quotes from "Quotes to Scrape" 📝

#### Objective

Your mission is to scrape quotes, authors, and tags from the **Quotes to Scrape** site. After collecting this data, you'll use Pandas to analyze the most frequently occurring words within the quotes and identify the authors with the most quotes listed on the site.

#### Steps

1. **Scrape Data**: Use Beautiful Soup to scrape quotes, their authors, and any tags associated with the quotes from the site. The structure of the site is straightforward, making it an excellent opportunity to practice extracting various types of information.

2. **Data Storage**: Organize the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. Structure the DataFrame with columns for the quote, author, and a list of tags for each quote.

3. **Basic Analysis**:
   - Identify the most common words used across all quotes. Consider filtering out common stopwords to focus on meaningful words.
   - Determine which authors have the most quotes on the site.

#### Guidelines for Scraping

- URL to scrape: `http://quotes.toscrape.com`
- The website is designed with simplicity in mind, with quotes neatly wrapped in `<span>` tags, authors in `<small>` tags, and tags within `<div>` tags of class `tags`.
- Since the site is made for scraping practice, you don't have to worry about legal issues or rate limiting.

#### Try It Yourself

1. **Scraping Part**:
   - Craft a script to extract quotes, authors, and tags from the site. Navigate through the structure to accurately locate and retrieve these elements.
2. **Analysis Part**:
   - Load your collected data into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Use text analysis techniques to find the most common words in the quotes, excluding stopwords.
   - Calculate which authors are most frequently quoted on the site.

#### Tips

- To deal with pagination (if you decide to scrape beyond the first page), inspect the site's structure to find how to navigate to subsequent pages.
- For text analysis, the `nltk` library's list of stopwords can be useful for filtering out common words.
- Utilize `collections.Counter` or Pandas' own functionality to count words and authors efficiently.

#### Deliverables

- A Python script that scrapes quotes, their authors, and tags from **Quotes to Scrape**.
- An analysis that highlights the most common words found in quotes and identifies the authors with the most quotes featured.
